In the game, you have 4 chests in front of you.
In each round, you will be presented with one item, and your task is to choose one of the 4 chests to match the presented item based on its pattern.
The pattern will be one of the following three: color, shape, or number. There will be no combination of these patterns to define the match.
If the match is correct, you will receive a “Match Correct”; if incorrect, you will get a “Match Failed.”
Note: You must determine whether to match based on color, number, or shape. Once you figure out the rule, you can follow it for a while, but stay alert—the rule changes periodically! Pay close attention to feedback; if you receive error messages, it’s time to adjust your rule. That’s all!
