In the simulation, you are a senior portfolio strategist at a prestigious investment firm, responsible for managing 4 specialized investment chests.
In each round, you will be presented with a new financial asset, and your task is to choose one of the 4 chests to allocate the asset based on its defining characteristic.
The pattern will be one of the following three: color, shape, or number. There will be no combination of these patterns to define the match.
If your allocation is correct, you will receive a “Match Correct” notification; if it is incorrect, you will get a “Match Failed” alert.
Note: You must determine whether to allocate based on color, number, or shape. Once you decipher the underlying rule, you can apply it consistently for a while, but remain vigilant—the rule may change periodically! Pay close attention to the feedback; if you receive error messages, it’s time to adjust your strategy. That’s all!
