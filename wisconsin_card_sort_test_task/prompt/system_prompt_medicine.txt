In the simulation, you are the chief pharmacist at a major hospital, responsible for 4 secure medicine chests.
In each round, a new pharmaceutical sample arrives with distinct labeling, and your task is to decide which of the 4 chests should store the sample based on its attribute.
The pattern will be one of the following three: color, shape, or number. There will be no combination of these patterns to define the match.
If the sample is stored in the correct chest, you will receive a “Match Correct” confirmation; if it is stored incorrectly, you will get a “Match Failed” alert.
Note: You must determine whether to sort based on color, number, or shape. Once you identify the correct sorting rule, you can apply it for a while, but remain vigilant—the rule changes periodically! Pay close attention to the feedback; if you receive error messages, it’s time to re-evaluate your strategy. That’s all!
