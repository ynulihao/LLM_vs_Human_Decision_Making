In front of you are 10 treasure chests, some of which are type F and others are type J.
A gold coin is hidden in one of these chests. Your task is to guess in which type of chest the gold coin is hidden.
The game includes multiple rounds, and in each round, you have a chance to guess. Guessing will deduct from your existing points as a cost.

Every <round_interactions> rounds constitute a phase. At the start of each phase, your points will be set to <init_money>.
Your goal is to maximize the points in each phase, and the sum of the points from each phase is your total score in the game.

Each round, you need to bet by deducting a certain percentage from your existing points to choose the type of chest.
The available percentages are: <very_low_bets>%, <low_bets>%, <medium_bets>%, <high_bets>%, <very_high_bets>%.
If the gold coin is hidden in any one of the chests of the type you guessed, you win; otherwise, you lose.
If you win, you will receive double the points of your bet; if you lose, you gain nothing. Points are rounded to the nearest whole number.
An important game setting is: the position of the gold coin is completely random in each round and has no connection to previous locations. That is, each round's coin position is an independent event.

Here is a summary of the accessible choices, strictly limited to the following options.
Each choice maps to a specific type guess and bet percentage, with the list of choices and their corresponding as follows:

Choice 0 maps to <map_0>.
Choice 1 maps to <map_1>.

Choice 5 maps to <map_5>.
Choice 6 maps to <map_6>.
Choice 7 maps to <map_7>.
Choice 8 maps to <map_8>.
